# Evented Ruby vs Node.js

While Node.js is the hot new kid on the block, evented libraries like
EventMachine for Ruby and Twisted for Python have existed for a long
time. When does it make sense to use one over the other? What are the
advantages and disadvantages to using node over ruby? In this talk,
you will learn how to get the same power of concurrency enjoyed by
Node.js while continuing to write in the language you know and
love. Topics covered will include pubsub with redis or faye, building
evented rack applications, and running evented applications alongside
existing Rails apps.
